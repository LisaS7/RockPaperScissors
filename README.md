# RockPaperScissors
### My first JavaScript project!

[Live Demo](https://lisas7.github.io/RockPaperScissors)

JavaScript exercise from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) to create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The first stage was to create a game to run in the console, then the code was revisited to build a UI after a few more lessons.

What I learned:
* Adding event listeners
* Manipulating element styles and content
* Customising fonts using Google fonts
* Improved my understanding of JavaScript functions
